                <p>The most important part is to cut back on sugars and starches (carbs).
                    These are the foods that stimulate secretion of insulin the most. If you didnâ€™t know already, insulin is the main fat storage hormone in the body.
                    When insulin goes down, fat has an easier time getting out of the fat stores and the body starts burning fats instead of carbs.
                    Another benefit of lowering insulin is that your kidneys shed excess sodium and water out of your body, which reduces bloat and unnecessary water weight (1, 2).
                    It is not uncommon to lose up to 10 pounds (sometimes more) in the first week of eating this way, both body fat and water weight.
                    This is a graph from a study comparing low-carb and low-fat diets in overweight/obese women (3).</p>
